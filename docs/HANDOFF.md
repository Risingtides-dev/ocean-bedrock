# Ocean Bedrock Handoff

Generated: 2026-06-11T03:41:35Z  
Repo: `/root/rt-nas/rt-nas`  
Service: `ocean-bedrock`  
Public URL: <https://ocean-bedrock-production.up.railway.app>

## 1. Handoff summary

Ocean Bedrock has been built and deployed as the cloud-box substrate for Ocean Longhouse support.

Current baseline is live:

```txt
health endpoint:     live
Postgres ledger:     live
shared file API:     live
scoped bearer auth:  live
MCP wrapper:         live
coworker bootstrap: live
ingest worker:       live for text chunking
semantic vectors:    not yet live
```

The system is usable today for:

- scoped file storage,
- coworker folder ingest,
- agent/MCP read/write/search,
- ledger events and snapshots,
- text chunk indexing into Postgres.

It is **not yet** a full vector/semantic knowledge engine because embeddings and Vectorize upserts are not implemented.

## 2. Critical guardrails

Do not violate these:

1. Do not redefine Ocean Longhouse in Bedrock docs.
2. Canonical split:
   - `ocean-daemon` = local runtime/body/execution authority.
   - `ocean-longhouse` = hive brain/coordination layer.
   - `ocean-bedrock` = cloud-box support substrate.
3. Do not hallucinate Ocean docs. Use canonical docs when discussing Ocean:
   - `ocean-os/docs/LONGHOUSE.md`
   - `ocean-os/docs/LONGHOUSE_ORCHESTRATION.md`
   - relevant `ocean-surface` docs for Surface-specific claims.
4. Do not commit or paste raw secrets into docs.
5. Coworker ingest must remain opt-in folder selection.
6. Coworker/agent tokens should be scoped bearer/MCP tokens, not admin tokens.
7. Avoid ingesting secrets by default.

```

Production env vars known to be set:

```txt
OCEAN_BEDROCK_ROOT=/data
OCEAN_BEDROCK_INSTANCE=ocean-bedrock
OCEAN_LEDGER_STORE=postgres
OCEAN_BEDROCK_WORKER_ENABLED=true
DATABASE_URL=<Railway Postgres URL>
OCEAN_BEDROCK_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN=<secret>
```

## 4. Token locations

Local token files on Lennox:

```txt
/root/.config/ocean-bedrock/railway-admin-token.txt
/root/.config/ocean-bedrock/operator-test-token.txt
/root/.config/ocean-bedrock/operator-contributor-token.txt
```

Do not commit these files. Do not copy the admin token into docs.

Normal operator/coworker testing should use:

```txt
/root/.config/ocean-bedrock/operator-contributor-token.txt
```

That token role is `contributor`:

```txt
can:    read, write, lock
cannot: delete, admin token ops
```

Scopes:

```txt
/coworkers/operator-contributor
/sessions/operator-contributor
/context/ocean-bedrock
```

```

Public route index:

```bash
curl "$OCEAN_BEDROCK_URL/"
```

Health:

```bash
curl "$OCEAN_BEDROCK_URL/health"
```

Authenticated info:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OCEAN_BEDROCK_TOKEN" \
  "$OCEAN_BEDROCK_URL/api/v1/info"
```

List scoped workspace:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OCEAN_BEDROCK_TOKEN" \
  "$OCEAN_BEDROCK_URL/api/v1/tree?path=/coworkers/operator-contributor&depth=5"
```

Write a file:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OCEAN_BEDROCK_TOKEN" \
  "$OCEAN_BEDROCK_URL/api/v1/search?q=handoff&path=/coworkers/operator-contributor&limit=10"
```

Delete should fail for contributor:

```bash
curl -i -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OCEAN_BEDROCK_TOKEN" \
  "$OCEAN_BEDROCK_URL/api/v1/file?path=/coworkers/operator-contributor/handoff-smoke.md"
```

Expected:

```txt
403 Token role "contributor" does not allow delete.
```

## 7. MCP verification

```bash
export OCEAN_BEDROCK_URL='https://ocean-bedrock-production.up.railway.app'
export OCEAN_BEDROCK_TOKEN="$(cat /root/.config/ocean-bedrock/operator-contributor-token.txt)"
npm run mcp
```

Already smoke-tested successfully:

```txt
initialize OK
tools/list OK, 10 tools
bedrock_list OK
bedrock_snapshot OK
```

MCP tools:

```txt
bedrock_info
bedrock_list
bedrock_read
bedrock_write
bedrock_mkdir
bedrock_search
bedrock_lock
bedrock_unlock
bedrock_trace
bedrock_snapshot
```

## 8. Database verification

Schema check:

```bash
npm run db:check
```

Expected:

```json
{
  "schemaReady": true,
  "tables": {
    "mounts": "longhouse.mounts",
    "ledgerEvents": "longhouse.ledger_events",
    "contextSnapshots": "longhouse.context_snapshots",
    "sourceAdapters": "longhouse.source_adapters",
    "sourceInstances": "longhouse.source_instances",
    "sourceStreams": "longhouse.source_streams",
    "sourceSyncRuns": "longhouse.source_sync_runs",
    "sourceRecords": "longhouse.source_records"
  },
  "sourceAdaptersSeeded": 8
}
```

Current DB state from last check:

```txt
objects:       19 files
chunks:        17
jobs done:     17
jobs failed:   9
ledgerEvents: 89
graphNodes:   17 file nodes
sourceAdapters: 8 seeded
sourceInstances: 6
sourceStreams: 6
sourceSyncRuns: 2 completed, 3 cancelled debug runs
sourceRecords: 2
```

Chunk status:

```txt
embedding_provider=none
embedding_model=text-chunk-v1
dimensions=0
vectorized=0
```

This confirms chunk indexing exists, but semantic vector search does not.

## 10. Source adapter registry status

Research doc created:

```txt
docs/SOURCE-ADAPTER-PRECEDENTS.md
```

Precedents reviewed:

```txt
Airbyte: connector spec + catalog + state
Singer/Meltano: config + catalog + state
Kafka Connect/Debezium: connector config + offsets + schema history
Dagster: configurable external resources
LangChain/LlamaIndex: loaders/readers -> document + metadata
Unstructured: source connectors + standardized metadata
```

Implemented live tables:

```txt
longhouse.source_adapters
longhouse.source_instances
longhouse.source_streams
longhouse.source_sync_runs
longhouse.source_records
```

Implementation status:

```txt
db/003_source_adapters.sql applied to Railway Postgres
8 adapter definitions seeded
src/sources.mjs helper module added
scripts/ocean-bootstrap.mjs writes source_instance/source_stream when DATABASE_URL is available
scripts/ocean-ingest-local.mjs writes source_sync_run/source_record and object_id lineage when DATABASE_URL is available
```

Verified smoke:

```txt
operator-contributor local_folder bootstrap registry: enabled
operator-contributor local_folder ingest registry: enabled
source_record created and linked to longhouse.objects.id
```

## 11. Next work queue

### Priority 1 — Commit source adapter registry

- Review changed source-registry files.
- Ensure no secrets are committed.
- Confirm `npm run smoke` passes.
- Confirm `npm run db:check` reports source tables and 8 seeded adapters.
- Commit source registry implementation.

### Priority 2 — Embeddings and Vectorize

Add:

```txt
Cloudflare Workers AI embedding client
Vectorize upsert support
semantic search endpoint
MCP semantic search tool
```

Existing Cloudflare resource:

```txt
Vectorize index: ocean-longhouse-context
```

Current chunk rows are ready to be reprocessed into vectors later.

### Priority 3 — R2 object adapter

Existing Cloudflare R2 bucket:

```txt
ocean-longhouse
```

Need:

```txt
R2 S3 access keys
Railway env vars
adapter for canonical object bytes
backfill/migration strategy from volume to R2 if desired
```

### Priority 4 — Real coworker rollout

A V0 local GUI app exists:

```bash
npm run ocean:app
```

It lets coworkers paste a scoped token, choose folders, run manual sync, and schedule sync while the app is open. See `docs/LOCAL-GUI-APP.md`.

Before issuing real coworker tokens:

- confirm path scopes,
- document install instructions,
- run a small real folder dry-run,
- inspect skipped files,
- verify secrets are ignored,
- issue contributor-only tokens,
- confirm delete is blocked.

## 12. Railway deploy runbook

Use Railway skill practices. From repo root:

```bash
export RAILWAY_CALLER="skill:use-railway@1.2.1"
export RAILWAY_AGENT_SESSION="railway-skill-$(date -u +%Y%m%d)-ocean-bedrock"
env -u RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID -u RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME \
  railway up --service ocean-bedrock --environment production --detach \
  -m "Deploy Ocean Bedrock changes"
```

Check status:

```bash
env -u RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID -u RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME \
  railway service status --service ocean-bedrock --json
```

After deploy:

```bash
curl -fsS https://ocean-bedrock-production.up.railway.app/health
```

## 13. Known issues

1. Embeddings/Vectorize are not implemented.
2. R2 bucket exists but object adapter/keys are not wired.
3. Failed ingest jobs exist from earlier worker attempts; inspect before production cleanup.
4. Token registry is volume JSON, not Postgres; okay for one Railway replica, not ideal for multi-replica.
5. `/vault` is just a folder placeholder, not an encrypted secrets vault.
6. Current search is file text search, not semantic search.
7. Current graph only creates basic file nodes, not entity/relationship extraction.
8. Source registry currently has V1 local_folder wiring only; GitHub/Telegram/Slack/Notion/Linear/Drive/R2 adapter runners are not implemented yet.

## 14. Acceptance criteria for next handoff

The next handoff should include:

- commit hash,
- latest Railway deployment ID,
- current live health output,
- DB counts,
- exact migration status,
- whether embeddings/vectorize are live,
- source adapter tables status,
- any issued coworker tokens by name/scope, not raw token values.
